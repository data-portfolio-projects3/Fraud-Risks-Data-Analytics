# üîç Flagged Transactions vs. Confirmed Suspicious Activity

### 1. Flagged Transaction / Alert

**Definition:**
A transaction that deviates from established patterns or triggers predefined rules within an anti-money laundering (AML) system.

**Key Points:**
*   **Automated Detection:** Alerts are generated by systems that monitor transactions for anomalies.
*   **Not an Accusation:** An alert indicates potential risk but does not confirm illicit activity.
*   **Requires Review:** Each alert necessitates a thorough investigation to determine its validity.

According to the FFIEC BSA/AML Manual, effective monitoring systems include components such as "Identification or alert of unusual activity," emphasizing the need for further investigation after an alert is generated.

### 2. Analyst / Investigator Review

**Purpose:**
To assess flagged transactions and determine whether they represent true risks requiring escalation.

**Process:**
*   **Examine Transaction Details:** Review the nature, amount, and frequency of the transaction.
*   **Assess Customer Profile:** Consider the customer's history and typical behavior.
*   **Evaluate Context:** Analyze the circumstances surrounding the transaction.
*   **Consult Documentation:** Verify supporting documents and information.

**Outcome:**
*   **Confirmed Suspicious Activity:** If the transaction is deemed suspicious, a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is filed.
*   **False Positive:** If the transaction is legitimate, the alert is closed without further action.

### 3. Confirmed Suspicious Activity

**Definition:**
A transaction or pattern of transactions that, after thorough investigation, is determined to be indicative of potential money laundering or other illicit activities.

**Regulatory Requirement:**
Financial institutions are mandated to file a SAR when they know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction involves illegal activity. LSEG

### 4. False Positives

**Definition:**
Legitimate transactions that are incorrectly flagged as suspicious by AML systems.

**Challenges:**
*   **Resource Intensive:** Investigating false positives consumes valuable time and resources.
*   **Customer Impact:** Can lead to unnecessary delays or disruptions for customers.

### 5. Balancing False Positives and False Negatives

**Objective:**
To minimize both false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as suspicious) and false negatives (suspicious activities not detected).

**Strategies:**
*   **Refine Detection Rules:** Continuously update and optimize AML detection algorithms.
*   **Enhance Data Quality:** Ensure accurate and comprehensive customer and transaction data.
*   **Implement AI and Machine Learning:** Utilize advanced technologies to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.
